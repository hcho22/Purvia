-- US-072 (ADR-0008): the public widget key registry + the not-revoked gate that
-- every key resolution passes through before anything is minted or created.
--
-- WHAT A WIDGET KEY IS (read carefully): `public_key` is NON-SECRET. It is
-- embedded verbatim in the buyer's page JS (the loader <script>, US-083) and is
-- therefore world-readable. It is NOT a credential and grants NO access by
-- itself: it only NAMES which workspace's support bot a widget instance speaks
-- to. The leaked-key blast radius is bounded to "the already-public KB answers"
-- (US-073 frames this), and the hard abuse controls are the rate limit +
-- circuit breaker (US-076/077), NOT the key's secrecy. So unlike
-- `conversation_tokens.token_hash` (US-071, a hashed customer credential) the
-- public_key is stored in the clear — there is nothing to hash.
--
-- TRUST MODEL (this is the ADMIN-MANAGEMENT surface, distinct from the three in
-- CLAUDE.md): widget keys are issued/rotated/revoked by workspace ADMINS in
-- /support/settings (US-090). Managing keys is exactly the administrative action
-- ADR-0002's `workspace_membership.role='admin'` exists for, so — and ONLY here,
-- never in a retrieval/visibility predicate — `role` legitimately enters the RLS
-- below. The public widget never reads this table under a Postgres role at all:
-- key resolution is backend-mediated (the backend reads under the service role,
-- gating on `revoked_at IS NULL`), the same posture US-071 uses for the customer
-- token. So the RLS here protects the ADMIN read/write path; the anonymous
-- public path bypasses it via the service role server-side.

-- widget_keys: one non-secret public key per (workspace, issuance). Multiple keys
-- per workspace are allowed on purpose — rotation is issue-new + revoke-old
-- (no auto-rotation), so an old key lingers (revoked) beside its replacement for
-- audit and to keep already-embedded loaders resolvable until the buyer swaps the
-- snippet. A revoked key blocks NEW conversations (resolution's gate) but never
-- terminates a live one: once a conversation's opaque token (US-071) is minted it
-- is independent of the key, so revocation cannot kill an in-flight chat.
