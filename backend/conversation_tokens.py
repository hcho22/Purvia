"""US-071: opaque per-conversation customer token primitives (ADR-0008, amends ADR-0004).

This token is the anonymous customer's reconnect credential. It is deliberately
NOT a Supabase JWT and is NOT signed with `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` — that secret
mints the *bot's* identity token (`backend.supabase_jwt.mint_supabase_jwt`,
US-068), a different mechanism entirely. Conflating the two would drag the
anonymous customer onto the Supabase trust surface, which is exactly what
ADR-0008 keeps them off of.

Instead the token is cryptographically-random opaque bytes:

  * `generate_conversation_token()` -> a fresh 256-bit `secrets.token_urlsafe`
    string, returned in the clear EXACTLY ONCE at conversation creation (only to
    the iframe; US-078 wires that flow).
  * `hash_conversation_token(raw)` -> the SHA-256 hex digest that is the ONLY
    representation stored server-side (`public.conversation_tokens.token_hash`).
    The raw token never touches the database, a log line, an SSE event, or any
    response body other than the single creation response.

Continuity comes solely from the iframe-origin-stored raw token: there is NO
server-side customer-identity table. On every reload the iframe presents the raw
token to the backend, which hashes it and calls the `resume_conversation` RPC
(service-role only) to revalidate (`not expired AND status != 'resolved'`) and
slide the 24h window. Resolve invalidates the token (the RPC's status gate plus
the purge-on-resolve trigger). See `supabase/migrations/20260623140000_conversation_tokens.sql`.

These primitives are pure (no DB, no secrets) so they are always unit-testable;
the DB issue/resume plumbing lives in `main.py` (the widget endpoints) and is
exercised by the integration layer of `test_us071_conversation_tokens.py`.
