"""US-048 validation test: the one-call runtime faithfulness gate (ADR-0003).

Exercises `escalation.faithfulness_gate` with a fake judge client that records
how many structured-output calls it receives — no real LLM, no network, no
secrets — so it runs anywhere, like `test_chat_mode_default.py`. The fake mirrors
the OpenAI SDK shape the gate reads (`completion.choices[0].message.parsed` /
`.refusal`), exactly as `metadata.extract_document_metadata` consumes it.

Covers the PRD validation test:
  * a grounded draft -> supported=True, passes (faithful);
  * an ungrounded draft -> fails;
  * EXACTLY ONE judge call per evaluation (no RAGAS-style multi-call decomp);
  * a forced judge exception -> unfaithful + structured judge failure
    (fail-closed; the pipeline defers this turn);
plus the cutoff `>=` boundary, refusal / empty-choices / missing-payload
fail-closed paths, score clamping to [0,1], and the JUDGE_MODEL selector.

Run:
    python -m backend.test_faithfulness_gate
