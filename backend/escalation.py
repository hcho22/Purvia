"""US-047: deterministic cosine-defined retrieval gate (ADR-0003).

The support face answers or escalates via a deterministic deflection pipeline
(US-049) — escalate-vs-answer is *control flow*, never a model `escalate()`
tool. The cheap left operand of that decision is this **retrieval gate**: pure
arithmetic on the raw, pre-fusion vector cosine (`cosine_similarity`, US-046)
that calls a query's retrieval "weak" — meaning *escalate before any draft or
faithfulness-judge call* — when the best hit is below `tau_sim` or too few hits
clear `match_threshold`. Because it makes no LLM/reranker call, it short-circuits
the expensive faithfulness gate (US-048) on genuinely-no-context queries.

It reads only `cosine_similarity`, never `similarity` — after hybrid fusion the
latter is the RRF rank artifact (a small absolute number, US-021), so a query
with a high RRF score but a low cosine must still be called weak. A reranker,
when present, overwrites `similarity` with its calibrated score but leaves
`cosine_similarity` intact (`reranking.py` `model_copy`s only `similarity`), so
the gate contract stays cosine and the gate survives deletion of the optional
reranker module (R4) — `escalation.py` imports nothing from `reranking`.

US-048: `faithfulness_gate` is the OR's expensive right operand, reached only
when the retrieval gate calls retrieval strong. It makes **exactly one**
structured-output judge call (ADR-0006 runtime judge role; `gpt-4o-mini` /
`haiku`-class) verifying the drafted answer is grounded in its retrieved chunks,
and fails **closed** — any judge error / refusal / parse failure / timeout is
treated as unfaithful and the affected turn is deferred, never auto-sent. This runtime gate is a
NET-NEW one-call check, NOT the offline RAGAS `faithfulness` metric in
`evals/retrieval/ragas.py` (which decomposes claims across several calls and
runs weekly); the same English word "faithfulness" names two distinct
machineries on two different latency budgets.

Issue #97: `answer_gate` is a SECOND, distinct runtime judge — grounding and
answering are orthogonal, and the faithfulness gate only checks the former. A
draft that says "I don't have that information about X" carries zero unsupported
claims, so the faithfulness judge scores it `supported=True` and (before this
gate) it was auto-sent and counted as a deflection though it answered nothing.
The retrieval gate cannot catch it either: retrieval is *strong* precisely
because the chunk is topically adjacent (the right subject, the wrong fact). So a
separate operand — composed per ADR-0003 as deterministic control flow, not a
model tool — verifies the draft actually ANSWERS the customer's question, and
fails **closed** like the faithfulness gate (any judge error defers the affected
turn). It runs
only on the would-be-answered path (after the draft clears faithfulness), so it
adds ONE judge call to a turn that was about to auto-resolve — exactly the
population at risk — and none to any escalate path.

Issue #105: a judge that cannot reach a verdict still fails the affected turn
closed, but that outage is not a deliberate human-handoff decision. Both judge
decision types carry `judge_failed=True` for exceptions, refusals, and malformed
responses. `run_deflection_pipeline` maps that structured signal to
`action="deferred"`, which returns the same generic customer message while keeping
the conversation active so a later turn can retry. Ordinary unfaithful/non-answer
verdicts remain `action="escalated"` and keep the one-way latch semantics.

US-049: `run_deflection_pipeline` wires the gates into the exact ADR-0003
control flow — `retrieve (hybrid, once) → retrieval gate → [if strong] draft →
faithfulness gate → answer gate → answer-or-escalate` — as deterministic control
flow, never a model `escalate()` tool and never the M1 agentic loop
(`MAX_TOOL_ITERATIONS` in `main.py`). The OR short-circuits on its cheap left
operand: a weak retrieval escalates having made ZERO draft and ZERO judge calls.
On any escalate the customer-facing message is a fixed generic deferral with NO
reason/access metadata; the decision tags live only on the internal result
fields (for logging / the US-067 conversation status), never in
`customer_message`.

US-050: `EscalationConfig` (+ the standalone `get_false_resolve_ceiling`) is the
ONE place the gate knobs are resolved from env and validated. The gates and the
pipeline above read no environment — they take explicit params, staying pure and
testable — so this config layer supplies the validated `tau_sim` / `n_min` /
`faithfulness_cutoff` the support endpoint (US-066+) spreads into
`run_deflection_pipeline` (alongside `retrieval.get_similarity_threshold()` for
`match_threshold`). TWO gate knobs sit outside that rule and are named here so the
exception is visible rather than discovered: `JUDGE_TEMPERATURE` (issue #104) and
`JUDGE_REASONING_EFFORT` are both read from env by `_judge_sampling_kwargs()` on
EVERY gate invocation, with no parameter override - unlike `JUDGE_MODEL`, which at
least has the gates' `model=` argument. Neither is an `EscalationConfig` field
because neither is a per-request decision input: each is a property of the JUDGE
DEPLOYMENT's request contract, resolved alongside `get_judge_model()` and never
varied per call site, so threading either through the pipeline would suggest a
caller may legitimately choose a different sampler per turn. The statement above
still holds for every knob `EscalationConfig` does own. The **false-resolve
ceiling** is a separate eval-time knob — the one number a buyer sets as their
risk tolerance, consumed by
the E7 sweep (US-058) and the E8 gate (US-059) — and is deliberately kept OFF the
per-request path (off `EscalationConfig` entirely) so it cannot leak into the
latency path.

# Both runtime gates are SAFETY gates that fail closed, and a gate that returns a
# different verdict on identical input is not doing that: it is sampling one. The
# 2026-08-03 E7 investigation measured the answer gate returning `answers=True`
# on 2 of 5 identical calls for the same (question, draft) pair — the send/escalate
# decision was partly a coin flip. Both gates now pin the sampler.
#
# What the pin buys, stated exactly: it REMOVES THE SAMPLER as a source of variance
# in the send/escalate verdict. It is not a guarantee that an identical (question,
# draft) can never yield a different verdict - no `seed` is passed, and
# provider-side temperature 0 is best-effort, not contractual. The measured defect
# it removes is real; the residual is model-side nondeterminism, which is a
# different and much smaller thing.
#
# The escape hatch exists because ADR-0006 lets an operator point `JUDGE_MODEL` at
# their own deployment, and not every deployment accepts the argument. There are
# TWO distinct rejections, and they do NOT share a remedy:
#
#   (1) The PARAMETER is refused outright. First-party OpenAI reasoning models
#       (o-series, `gpt-5-*`) do this, at ANY value including the pinned default,
#       so it is a 400 on every call from the moment the deployment is pointed
#       there. The remedy is `JUDGE_TEMPERATURE=none`, which omits the parameter
#       entirely - there is no number that works.
#
#   (2) The VALUE is refused as outside that endpoint's accepted range. This one
#       CANNOT fire at the shipped default: `DEFAULT_JUDGE_TEMPERATURE` is 0.0,
#       which is inside every provider's range including an Anthropic-compatible
#       endpoint's `[0,1]`. It only happens once an operator has explicitly set a
#       number above that endpoint's cap, and the remedy is then to set a value
#       the endpoint accepts (`0` keeps the gates pinned). Reaching for the
#       opt-out here would un-pin a safety gate the operator could have kept
#       pinned; it is the alternative only if they would rather send nothing at
#       all. `_JUDGE_TEMPERATURE_MAX` does not protect against this and is not
#       trying to: a validator cannot know each bring-your-own endpoint's range.
#
# Either way the escape hatch is a typed-out operator decision rather than
# something inferred from a provider's error text - guessing at free-text 400s on a
# safety path is unsafe in both directions, since reading one too loosely un-pins a
# gate on an echoed payload and reading one too strictly leaves the gate failing
# closed on every turn. Setting the knob to a number is an explicit operator
# decision to give up the determinism these gates depend on.
#
# The knob resolves as: unset ⇒ the pinned default; blank ⇒ the pinned default;
# `none` ⇒ omit the parameter; anything else ⇒ a number, or the pinned default.
# Blank is deliberately NOT the opt-out. An empty environment variable is a common
# accidental state - a bare `-e JUDGE_TEMPERATURE` in Docker, an empty configMap
# value, a trailing `JUDGE_TEMPERATURE=` in a .env - and treating that accident as
# an opt-out silently returns a safety gate to sampling, which is the exact defect
# this knob exists to remove. Every sibling knob in this module (`_env_unit_float`,
# `_env_min_int`) already reads unset/blank as the default; this one being
# different was the bug, not the convention. Un-pinning must be typed out.

    Unlike `warn_if_judge_rejects_temperature`, this takes NO `support_configured`
    gate. The four helpers it covers - planner, text-to-SQL, LLM reranker,
    sub-agent - all run on the CORE knowledge-assistant chat/retrieval path that
    every deploy runs, not the support-widget path. So this warning's premise
    holds for every deploy and it must not be scoped to the widget surface.

    The answerer model is `OPENAI_MODEL` (default `gpt-4o-mini`, resolved in
    main.py). Each helper falls through its own selector env var
    (`OPENAI_PLANNER_MODEL`, `OPENAI_SQL_MODEL`, `OPENAI_RERANK_MODEL`,
    `OPENAI_SUBAGENT_MODEL`) to `OPENAI_MODEL`. A helper whose selector carries any
    explicit value is the operator's deliberate choice and is SKIPPED; only a
    helper with an unset/empty selector inherits the answerer and is named here.
    Three of the four (planner, text-to-SQL, reranker) send a hardcoded
    `temperature=0.0` with no escape hatch, so if the inherited answerer refuses
    the parameter they 400 on the first real request.

    Best-effort operator aid, nothing more, and wrong in BOTH directions - the
    same way `warn_if_judge_rejects_temperature` is. FALSE NEGATIVES: it reuses the
    hand-maintained `_TEMPERATURE_REFUSING_MODEL_PREFIXES` (less the
    `_NON_REASONING_CHAT_MARKER` convention), so a refusing deployment under any
    name not in that tuple - a newer model, or an OpenAI-compatible endpoint under
    another name, or a name carrying the `-chat` marker - is missed silently. FALSE
    POSITIVES: a name in the tuple is a family guess, never an observed refusal, so
    a matching answerer may accept `temperature` perfectly well. Because it can be
    wrong either way, the log line tells the operator to VERIFY before acting.

    Boot-time only, by construction: called from the startup hook, never on the

    `support_configured` is the caller's answer to "can these gates ever run on
    this deploy?" - the two gates execute only on the support-widget path
    (`support_bot` -> `run_deflection_pipeline`), and per AGENTS.md invariant 10 a
    knowledge-assistant-only deploy leaves the widget surface unconfigured, so every
    `/widget/*` route 503s and no judge call is ever made. Passing `False` returns
    without logging: the message below is accurate in itself, but its PREMISE does
    not hold for that operator - it would describe conversations latching in a
    deploy that has no conversations. A correct warning shown to the wrong audience
    is still wrong, and invariant 10 says such a deploy is UNAFFECTED by the support
    surface. It is a required argument rather than an env read here so the caller
    that owns the widget-surface predicate states it explicitly, and so both
    directions are pinnable without booting the app.

    Best-effort operator aid, nothing more, and wrong in both directions. It
    compares the configured `JUDGE_MODEL` against the hand-maintained
    `_TEMPERATURE_REFUSING_MODEL_PREFIXES`, less any name carrying the
    `_NON_REASONING_CHAT_MARKER` convention, and warns when the pin is also in
    effect. FALSE NEGATIVES: it does NOT guarantee detection, does not prevent the
    breakage, and does not make the upgrade safe - a refusing deployment whose name
    is not in that tuple, a newer model or an OpenAI-compatible endpoint under any
    other name, is missed silently, and so is one whose name happens to carry the
    `-chat` marker. That marker rule is deliberately broad, and broad means MORE
    misses, not more false alarms. FALSE POSITIVES: a name in the tuple is a
    heuristic, never an observation, so a matching deployment may accept
    `temperature` perfectly well. The whole claim is that it reduces the chance of a
    silent surprise for the families we already know about.

    Because it can be wrong either way, the log line it emits is conditional and
    tells the operator to VERIFY before changing configuration - a human acts on the
    message, not on this docstring, so the message must hedge at least as carefully
    as this does.

    It exists because the pin is a NEW request parameter on an upgrade path: an
    operator already running one of these models has a working deployment today, and
    if that judge does refuse the parameter then every call 400s, both gates fail
    closed on every turn, and per issue #105 the latch site cannot tell that from a
    deliberate escalate, so affected conversations latch to `escalated` permanently.
    Docs alone do not reach an operator mid-upgrade.

    Boot-time only, by construction: it is called from the startup hook, never from
    `_judge_parse` or either gate, so it adds nothing to the request path and can
    never alter a gate decision. It never raises and never blocks startup - a

    reasoning" is limited to that same known list, so this cannot promise the value

# Issue #97: one-call runtime ANSWER-COMPLETENESS gate.
#
# The faithfulness gate proves the draft doesn't LIE; it says nothing about
# whether the draft ANSWERS. A grounded non-answer ("I don't have that
# information about X") is trivially faithful — zero unsupported claims — so
# without this gate it auto-sends and is counted as a deflection though the
# customer got nothing. This is a SECOND, orthogonal judge call that verifies the
# draft actually addresses the customer's question, and — like the faithfulness
# gate — fails **closed**: any judge error / refusal / parse failure / timeout is
# treated as a non-answer that defers this turn, never auto-sent. It compares the QUESTION
# against the DRAFT (NOT the chunks — grounding is the other gate's job); it is
# the runtime companion to the OFFLINE-only `answer_relevancy` RAGAS metric
# (`evals/retrieval/ragas.py`), which gates CI regressions, never an individual
# customer reply.
#
# Issue #104: the rubric originally caught only the shape that ANNOUNCES itself —
# a draft saying it lacks the information. It missed the shape where the CORPUS's
# own answer is a deferral. Asked "what is the return shipping fee for a return
# over 20 lbs?", the corpus says "quoted per-case for returns over 20 lbs"
# (`db_seed/corpus/returns-process.md:33`); a draft restating that is faithful,
# fluent, and occupies exactly the slot the question asked about, so the gate read
# the slot as filled and auto-sent. The customer still has no fee. Same for a book
# warranty "at the discretion of customer service"
# (`db_seed/corpus/warranty-terms.md:29`).
#
# Those two shapes are ORTHOGONAL, and the fix has to name the second explicitly:
# whether the draft admits ignorance is a fact about the DRAFTER, whether the
# customer ends up holding the requested value is a fact about the ANSWER. Before
# the added clause the gate keyed mostly on the first, which the drafter emits or
# omits at its own sampling temperature — so the send/escalate decision partly rode
# on a phrasing coin flip (`backend/test_answer_gate_rubric.py` pins both shapes).

    withholds the unchecked draft on the customer request path. So an unregistered
    tag logs and still returns a structured judge failure; it must not turn a

    `python -O` strips out of an optimized deployment entirely.

    Its scope is exactly the tags passed to `_non_answer`, and no wider: the test
    walks CALLS to this helper, so a fail-closed branch that builds an
    `AnswerDecision` directly is invisible to it - and `answer_gate` already
    constructs decisions that way for its two real verdicts, so the pattern is at
