"""US-049 validation test: the deterministic deflection pipeline orchestrator.

Drives the **real** `escalation.run_deflection_pipeline` end to end: hybrid
retrieval runs through an `httpx.MockTransport` (the Supabase RPCs are stubbed
and call-counted, proving "hybrid, once"), and the embedder / answerer / judge
are call-counting fakes — no real LLM, no DB, no secrets, so it runs anywhere.

Covers the PRD validation test:
  * an off-topic (weak-retrieval) message -> escalate with the generic deferral,
    making ZERO draft calls and ZERO judge calls (the OR short-circuits on its
    cheap left operand);
  * a supported message -> a drafted answer that passed the faithfulness gate AND
    the issue-#97 answer-completeness gate, with exactly ONE draft call, ONE
    faithfulness-judge call, and ONE answer-gate call;
  * a grounded NON-answer ("I don't have that information") -> escalate: the
    faithfulness judge blesses it (no unsupported claims) but the answer gate
    catches that it answered nothing, so it is NOT sent as a silent deflection
    (issue #97);
  * the draft is a plain completion with NO `tools` (the agentic loop is never
    entered);
plus strong-but-unfaithful -> escalate (before the answer gate), empty-draft ->
escalate (no judge call), faithfulness-judge and answer-judge failures -> defer
this turn without a deliberate escalation (issue #105), malformed non-finite or
coercive payloads -> the same typed deferral at both judge positions, and the
invariant that a deferral's customer-facing message NEVER leaks the gate `reason`
/ scores.
