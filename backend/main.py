"""FastAPI backend for the Agentic RAG app.

US-004 scope:
  * POST /api/chat streams an OpenAI Responses API reply (with optional
    file_search retrieval) back to the client via Server-Sent Events.
  * Supabase JWT from the browser is validated against GoTrue and then
    forwarded to PostgREST so row-level security still applies to every
    DB mutation.
  * Each turn: persist the user message, stream the assistant reply,
    persist the assistant message, update threads.openai_thread_id with
    the new response id so the next turn can continue server-side.

US-011: same endpoint now branches on `mode`. `responses` keeps the
managed-thread behaviour above; `completions` swaps in the stateless
Chat Completions API, rebuilds conversation context from the Supabase
messages table, and runs a manual tool-call loop that exposes the
`search_documents` tool (US-010).

# `widget_keys.allowed_origins` — NEVER FRONTEND_ORIGINS. So the public surface
# never inherits the authenticated app's origin trust, and `/api/*` never trusts a
# widget origin: the two origin sets are independent (an app origin is rejected at
# `/widget/*`; a widget origin is rejected at `/api/*`).
#
# CORS is a BROWSER-side control and DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH here, NOT the hard boundary.
# A preflight (OPTIONS) carries no body, so the specific `public_key` is unknown at
# preflight time — this layer can only answer "is this Origin registered for SOME
# active key". The authoritative PER-KEY origin gate (US-073) + not-revoked gate
# (US-072) + rate limit (US-076) all run inside the endpoints under the real

    Existing chunks whose content hash matches a new chunk have their

    NULL `content_hash` are treated as "not reusable" and get re-embedded on
    their first post-migration ingest — one-time backfill via normal use.

    We fetch existing rows first, then embed, then delete-and-reinsert so a
    mid-pipeline failure never leaves half-written chunks behind (matches the
    pre-US-015 safety boundary).

# US-072: widget_keys — the non-secret public-key registry + the not-revoked gate
# every key resolution passes before anything is minted/created (ADR-0008).
#
# Two faces, deliberately on different CORS/auth surfaces:
#   * ADMIN management (`/api/support/widget-keys*`) — authed by the admin's real
#     Supabase JWT; issuance/list/revoke INSERT/SELECT/UPDATE under that JWT so the
#     admin RLS (role='admin' of the workspace) is the authorization. The /support
#     /settings UI (US-090) is the caller. These ride the authenticated /api/* CORS.
#   * PUBLIC resolution (`/widget/keys/resolve`) — anonymous; the widget loader
#     (US-083) presents its non-secret public_key on open. Resolution gates on
#     `revoked_at IS NULL` under the SERVICE ROLE (the anonymous widget holds no
#     Postgres role) and leaks no workspace topology. Public-widget CORS is US-074,
#     per-key origin enforcement US-073, rate-limiting US-076 — all layer on top of
#     this gate without changing it; these routes do not widen the /api/* posture.

    The shared core of the two public-widget windows (`_enforce_widget_session_limit`

    `asyncio.gather` over both) lets the endpoint short-circuit between them: a
    session-throttled request 429s WITHOUT charging the per-key window, and the
    per-key window is charged only for a key that has already resolved (exists) —
    so a rotating-fake-key attacker can never mint a permanent per-key counter row.

    Both are charged on every call (a blocked hit STILL counts — it keeps a
    hammering caller saturated while a backed-off caller recovers as the window
    slides). On breach we raise a 429 having done NO costly work. This refusal is
    DISTINCT from the US-077 circuit breaker, which returns a 200 generic deferral
    — a throttle says "slow down" (retry the same request), a tripped breaker says
    "a human will follow up" (no retry needed).

    Coarse v1 accounting (PRD F3): requests-per-window, `cost`-weighted — NOT
    precise token/$ metering. `cost` lets a heavier endpoint (e.g. US-078's
    message turn, which drives a full deflection pipeline) charge more than a
    cheap key-resolution open.

    unconfigured, and every widget endpoint 503s before reaching anything costly
    in that case (a built limiter IS the enforcement; its absence == inert
    surface). App-level limiting is the portable default; an edge/WAF limiter is
    the recommended production complement (P5).

    FAILS OPEN on any limiter-backend error: `rate_limit_counters` live in the

    must NOT 500 the entire public widget surface — availability wins and the

    the already-public KB. The check is fail-closed (`is_origin_allowed`): a key
    with an empty/null allowlist is INACTIVE, and a missing/unlisted `Origin` is
    refused — never fail-open. The not-revoked gate stays FIRST; origin is an
    additional gate layered on top of it, ordered after so a revoked key and an
    unlisted origin are indistinguishable in the response.

    Anonymous public surface: Public-widget CORS is US-074's concern,
    rate-limiting US-076's — both layer on top of this gate. These routes do not
    widen the authenticated /api/* CORS posture.

    US-076 rate limit (two single-window helpers, charged with a short-circuit
    between them so a non-existent key never mints a per-key counter row): the
    PER-SESSION window is charged FIRST, after the cheap shape guard (a malformed
    key is a free 404, not worth a counter write) but BEFORE the DB resolve — a
    session-throttled request 429s having touched no DB / retrieval / LLM and
    written no per-key row. The PER-KEY window is charged only AFTER the resolve
    proves the key exists, so a rotating-fake-key attacker can never amplify the
    counter table through this path. US-078's first-message flow re-runs the same
    helpers (with a higher `cost`) on the conversation-create path.

# US-078 (ADR-0008): lazy conversation creation on the FIRST customer message.
#
# Widget OPEN does ONLY rate-limited key resolution (POST /widget/keys/resolve) —
# no `conversations` row, no token, no SSE — so a public page that is merely
# loaded (or a crawler hammering the embed) creates ZERO rows. A conversation (and
# its opaque customer token, US-071) is born only when a human actually sends a
# first message, bounding the public abuse surface to one-row-per-real-
# conversation (PRD ADR-0008 / CONTEXT lifecycle). Every later turn carries the
# stored token and RESUMES the same row (US-071) — a reload never duplicates it.
#
# The message endpoint is the REQUEST-SCOPED SSE the bot's answer streams over
# (like /api/chat). It announces the `conversation` event, then US-079 runs the
# deterministic ADR-0003 deflection turn AS the bot (behind the US-077 breaker),
# persists the bot reply, and streams it as `delta` events before `done`. The
# escalation latch (`status='escalated'`) is US-080 and the long-lived
# async-agent-reply SSE is US-081.
#
# The raw token is delivered EXACTLY ONCE in the `X-Conversation-Token` RESPONSE
# HEADER — never an SSE event, response body, or log line (US-071 sharp edge). The
# widget CORS posture (US-074) exposes that header so the cross-origin iframe can
# read it once; thereafter the iframe sends it back in the request header.

    Branches on the presence of the opaque per-conversation token (US-071):

        gates server-side (US-072 not-revoked + US-073 origin, reusing the SAME
        helpers as `/widget/keys/resolve` — open-time resolution is advisory;

        returned EXACTLY ONCE in the `X-Conversation-Token` RESPONSE HEADER — never
        in the SSE body / an event / a log line.
      * `X-Conversation-Token` present → RESUME. The service-role-only RPC resolves
        it to its ONE bound conversation iff not-expired AND not-resolved; NO row
        is created, so a reload never duplicates the conversation. A missing /
        expired / resolved token → 401, the iframe's cue to start fresh.

    The customer message is persisted to `conversation_messages` (role='user',
    `tool_calls` null) under the service role before the SSE opens, so it survives
    a client disconnect and the transcript (US-071 GET) always reflects what was
    received.

    The response is the REQUEST-SCOPED SSE the bot's answer streams over (like
    `/api/chat`): after the `conversation` event, US-079 runs the deterministic
    ADR-0003 deflection pipeline AS the workspace bot (behind the US-077
    per-workspace breaker), persists the bot reply (role='assistant', `tool_calls`
    null), and streams it as `delta` events before `done`. On the escalate branch
    (weak retrieval, unfaithful draft, a tripped breaker, or any failure) it streams
    the fixed generic deferral — never a confident answer. The escalation LATCH
    (`status='escalated'`) is US-080; the long-lived async-reply SSE is US-081.

    Rate limiting (US-076, heavier `cost` than a resolve open): the PER-SESSION/IP
    window is charged FIRST (before any DB work) on both branches; the PER-KEY
    window is charged on the first-message branch only AFTER the key resolves (a
    resume has no public_key to key on — the per-session window + the per-workspace
    breaker, US-077/079, bound a resumed conversation). A malformed first-message
    key is a FREE 404 (no counter write), mirroring `/widget/keys/resolve`. Every
