"""FastAPI backend for the Agentic RAG app.

US-004 scope:
  * POST /api/chat streams an OpenAI Responses API reply (with optional
    file_search retrieval) back to the client via Server-Sent Events.
  * Supabase JWT from the browser is validated against GoTrue and then
    forwarded to PostgREST so row-level security still applies to every
    DB mutation.
  * Each turn: persist the user message, stream the assistant reply,
    persist the assistant message, update threads.openai_thread_id with
    the new response id so the next turn can continue server-side.

US-011: same endpoint now branches on `mode`. `responses` keeps the
managed-thread behaviour above; `completions` swaps in the stateless
Chat Completions API, rebuilds conversation context from the Supabase
messages table, and runs a manual tool-call loop that exposes the
`search_documents` tool (US-010).

    NULL `content_hash` are treated as "not reusable" and get re-embedded on
    their first post-migration ingest — one-time backfill via normal use.

    We fetch existing rows first, then embed, then delete-and-reinsert so a
    mid-pipeline failure never leaves half-written chunks behind (matches the
    pre-US-015 safety boundary).

    (`chunks_added`, `chunks_removed`, `chunks_unchanged`, `chunks_total`) and
