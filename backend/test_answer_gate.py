"""Issue #97 validation test: the one-call runtime answer-completeness gate.

Exercises `escalation.answer_gate` with a fake judge client that records how many
structured-output calls it receives — no real LLM, no network, no secrets — so it
runs anywhere, exactly like `test_faithfulness_gate.py`. The fake mirrors the
OpenAI SDK shape the gate reads (`completion.choices[0].message.parsed` /
`.refusal`).

The gate is the missing runtime operand: the faithfulness gate proves the draft
doesn't LIE, this gate proves it ANSWERS. A grounded non-answer ("I don't have
that information about X") is trivially faithful, so without this gate it
auto-sends and is counted as a deflection though it answered nothing.

Covers:
  * a real answer -> answers=True, passes;
  * a non-answer / deferral -> fails (escalate);
  * EXACTLY ONE judge call per evaluation;
  * a forced judge exception -> non-answer + structured judge failure
    (fail-closed; the pipeline defers this turn);
  * the pinned sampler (issue #104), and that NO error shape is ever retried —
    including a 400 that names `temperature`, whose remedy is the typed-out
    `JUDGE_TEMPERATURE=none` rather than anything inferred at call time;
  * the cutoff `>=` boundary, refusal / empty-choices / missing-payload
    fail-closed paths, score clamping to [0,1], and that the QUESTION + DRAFT (but
    NOT the chunks) reach the judge — grounding is the other gate's job.

Run:
    python -m backend.test_answer_gate
