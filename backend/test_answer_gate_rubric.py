"""Issue #104: the answer-completeness gate's RUBRIC, as opposed to its plumbing.

`test_answer_gate.py` drives `answer_gate` through a fake judge that returns a
canned verdict. That pins the plumbing — exactly-one-call, fail-closed, clamping,
cutoff — and it is deliberately blind to what the rubric actually DISCRIMINATES,
because the fake never reads the prompt. Until this file there was no layer below
the weekly E7 sweep where a rubric change could be pinned at all, which is why the
issue-#104 gap survived from the gate's authoring (PR #99) to the 2026-08-03 sweep.

THE GAP THIS FILE PINS
----------------------
The original rubric caught the shape that ANNOUNCES itself — a draft saying it
lacks the information. It missed the shape where the CORPUS's own answer is a
deferral. `db_seed/corpus/returns-process.md:33` says return shipping over 20 lbs
is "quoted per-case"; `db_seed/corpus/warranty-terms.md:29` says a book warranty
claim past 30 days is "at the discretion of customer service". A draft restating
either is faithful, fluent, and lands exactly on the slot the question asked
about, so the gate read the slot as filled and auto-sent. The customer still has
no fee and no warranty period. `e7-p3-05` and `e7-p3-11` false-resolved that way.

Those two shapes are ORTHOGONAL, and both must be pinned:
  * whether the draft ADMITS ignorance is a fact about the drafter;
  * whether the customer ends up HOLDING the requested value is a fact about the
    answer.
Keying on the first alone made the send/escalate verdict ride on whether
`gpt-4o-mini` happened to append "Therefore, I don't have that information" — an
observed coin flip across runs of the same row.

A KNOWN LIMITATION of the issue-#104 clause
-------------------------------------------
The clause is stated UNCONDITIONALLY: a reply that only reports the answer is
quoted case-by-case / at someone's discretion / decided by staff / unpublished
"does NOT answer the question". It never conditions on WHAT was asked. That is
right for the two E7 rows it was built from, which both ask for a value the
corpus defers. It is wrong for a question whose correct answer genuinely IS the
policy or the disposition — "Who decides a book warranty claim after 30 days?"
is fully answered by "customer service, at their discretion", yet the rubric
reads that draft as a deferral and escalates it.

The last row of `_CASES` pins that shape at its CURRENT behaviour so a future
rubric change cannot alter it unnoticed. Fixing the clause means editing both
rubric strings, which invalidates the live measurement they were validated
against, so it is deferred rather than smuggled in here.

LIVE CALLS vs RECORDED FIXTURES — the deliberate choice
-------------------------------------------------------
This file makes LIVE model calls in its integration layer, and records nothing.

Recorded fixtures were considered and rejected for the discrimination cases. A
recorded judge response is a canned verdict replayed from disk, which is exactly
what the `_FakeJudge` already does: it would re-pin the plumbing under a new name
while still never exercising the rubric. A fixture can only tell you that the
model said X on the day you recorded it, so the one failure mode this layer exists
to catch — a rubric edit that changes what the model concludes — is precisely the
one it would be blind to.

What that costs, stated plainly:
  * money and latency: `len(_CASES) * _REPS` calls per implementation, on the two
    cheap judge models, so a full run with both keys set is
    `len(_CASES) * _REPS * 2`. Read it off the table rather than trusting a
    hand-count here - `_cost_note()` prints the current number at run time, and a
    row added to `_CASES` moves it without this paragraph needing an edit;
  * a dependency on network + API keys, so it CANNOT be part of the always-run
    unit layer;
  * mild non-determinism. Mitigated, not hand-waved: both judges are now pinned
    to temperature 0 (issue #104's other half) - the live layer neutralizes the
    ambient `JUDGE_MODEL` / `JUDGE_TEMPERATURE` exactly as the unit layer does, so
    a developer shell cannot un-pin the run the failure message describes as
    pinned - each case is asserted UNANIMOUS over `_REPS` calls, and every case in
    the table was measured stable at 5/5
    during the investigation. The pin removes the SAMPLER, which is best-effort
    rather than a guarantee — no `seed` is passed — so a split can still come
    from the provider rather than from the rubric. It fails the test either way,
    because both causes need looking at and neither should be retried away.

The offline half stays fixture-free in a different sense: it reads the two rubric
strings out of the source and asserts they carry the same rules. That needs no
model at all, so it runs in the always-on layer and is what actually catches the
two implementations drifting apart.

Layers (the project convention — see CLAUDE.md "How to test"):
  * unit layer, ALWAYS runs, no network/keys/DB: rubric lockstep + rule presence,
    executable structured judge-failure behavior, plus the boot warning's
    call-site wiring in `main.py`.
  * integration layer, SKIPS CLEANLY without keys: live discrimination on both
    implementations.

    derived from the widget-surface env var rather than hard-coded or dropped.
    That is the regression it is here for: `warn_if_judge_rejects_temperature`'s
    scoping to the support surface (AGENTS.md invariant 10) lives entirely in
    `main.py`, where an edit that hoists the call out of that predicate, passes a
    constant, or deletes the call altogether otherwise leaves the whole suite

    WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE — do not read it as more than the above:
      * NOT that the warning is correctly scoped at RUNTIME. It never boots the
        app, never imports `main`, and observes no log record.
      * NOT that `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is the RIGHT condition. It only
        checks that the argument mentions that name.

        SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — the exact inversion of the intended
        scoping — satisfies this check.

    behaviour; neither, alone or together, is an end-to-end runtime check.

    SOURCE, not runtime, deliberately. The call site only executes inside
    FastAPI's startup hook, and every test module that imports `main` does so
    behind a skip-on-failure guard (missing Supabase env, or the ML import stack
    the offline guard job does not install), so a runtime version of this check
    would go quiet in exactly the CI job that is supposed to enforce it. A guard
