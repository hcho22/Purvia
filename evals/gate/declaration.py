"""US-102 (Epic F, ADR-0005): pin the security/correctness gate to `fail`.

This is the **gate-declaration loader**. A buyer authors a declaration (a YAML
file that ships beside their golden set, US-103) whose ``verdicts:`` block sets a
per-output loudness knob (``off | comment | fail``, US-104) over the **quality**
metrics. This loader enforces the single US-102 invariant:

    A ``security``-class output (E4 / E6 / AU4 / E7-P1b) can NEVER appear in that
    verdict map. Security invariants are pinned ``fail`` and are simply *not
    present in the tunable verdict space* — the only way to stop one is to
    **delete** its eval/golden labels (a loud, tracked diff, US-110), never a
    quiet config flag.

So a declaration that tries ``E4_zero_leak: off`` (or ``e6_workspace_boundary:
comment``) is a **hard load error** with an actionable message, not a silent
downgrade. This is what makes "the security gates cannot be turned off, and here
is the eval that proves it" a true statement a buyer's security reviewer can
audit.

Scope discipline (US-102 + US-103):

* US-102 owns the ``verdicts:`` section — the tunable loudness map — and the
  security pin (a ``security``-class output can never carry a verdict).
* US-103 adds the ``bindings:`` section — the detection layer's project-specific
  bindings (cells, the cross-family judge map / cell, threshold constants) that
  ``evals.retrieval.ragas_gates`` used to hardcode as module constants. This
  loader parses them into a :class:`~evals.retrieval.ragas_gates.GateBindings`
  (the object the three detection functions take), with a hard error on an
  unknown cell / metric / section (no silent skip). The default declaration
  reproduces today's constants byte-for-byte, so the genericized path is
  identical to the legacy one (the regression guard lives in
  ``evals/gate/test_gate_bindings.py``).
* Still to come: US-104 adds the ``(severity, knob) -> action`` verdict function
  that consumes ``verdicts``; US-105 adds the per-PR-vs-scheduled determinism
  check. Each extends ``_KNOWN_SECTIONS`` / this dataclass; none may relax the
  security pin.
* A verdict key is a registered **eval-output name** (matching US-102's own
  validation test, which authors ``E4_zero_leak: off``). US-104 layers the
  per-suite grouping on top of this per-output map; a security-output key stays
  rejected regardless of granularity, because a security output is in no suite.

The class name for the loudness value is the AC's ``off | comment | fail`` verdict
(spelled ``loudness`` in :mod:`evals.gate.classes`, off the reserved ``class``
keyword there).
