"""US-102 (Epic F, ADR-0005): security invariants as binary asserts.

Security-class outputs are pinned ``fail`` (US-102) and evaluated as **binary
``assert``s**, never a threshold comparison a buyer can loosen. This module holds
the E4 zero-leak binary assert over the runner's ``security_no_access`` table:

    for every ``no_access`` cell, ``security_no_access[filter][mode] == 1.0``

i.e. *every* ``no_access`` run must have retrieved **zero** gold chunks. Any cell
below ``1.0`` means at least one run under a no-access viewer returned gold — a
leak — and is a violation that fails the run non-zero, **independent of any buyer
verdict config** (there is no knob; see :mod:`evals.gate.declaration`).

This closes a real gap: ``runner.py`` computed and *rendered* ``security_no_access``
in the summary but never hard-asserted it to be ``1.0``. Wiring this evaluator into
the runner's exit path makes an E4 leak fail the build the same way an E6
cross-workspace leak already does.

The sibling security invariants are asserted at their own call sites and are NOT
re-implemented here (this module owns only the E4 table):

* **E6** — the cross-workspace leak assert lives in ``runner.py::amain`` (the
  ``e6_result.leak_detected`` block) over ``evals/retrieval/e6.py``.
* **AU4** — deterministic ``assert == 0`` cases in
  ``backend/test_au4_auth_attacks.py``.
* **E7-P1b** — customer-facing P1b ≡ P1a, asserted on the E7 escalation runner.

All four are enumerated by :func:`evals.gate.classes.security_outputs`; this
module cross-links E4 back to that registry so the two cannot silently drift.

Run the tests: ``python -m evals.gate.test_pinned_security``
