"""US-052/053/054/055/056/057/058/059 validation test: E7 legs + metrics + sweep + P1b.

Drives the **real** `e7_runner.run_e7_p1a` / `run_e7_p2` / `run_e7_p3` /
`run_e7_p1b` end to end with call-counting fakes (no DB, no network, no LLM) — the
gate they call is the **real** `escalation.retrieval_gate`, so this test breaks if
a future PR breaks the gate — then feeds the real per-leg results into the real
`e7_runner.compute_e7_metrics` and the real `e7_runner.run_e7_sweep`.

P1a (US-052) — covers the PRD validation test:
  * a P1a question whose answer is absent from the corpus -> decision `escalate`,
    caught at the retrieval gate, with ZERO draft and ZERO judge calls; the
    recorded `top1_cosine` / `n_cleared` make a near-miss visible;
plus the failure indicators:
  * a P1a row that CLEARS the gate (strong retrieval) is flagged `correct=False`
    and fails the run — a retrieval-leg false-resolve the eval must detect (so a
    "pass" is never structurally blind);
  * the gate thresholds the real pre-fusion COSINE, not the RRF `similarity` rank
    artifact (a keyword-only row with a huge `similarity` but no cosine is weak);
  * a run with no P1a rows is NOT a pass (structurally blind guard);
  * the decision path is deterministic (same input -> same output).

P2 (US-053) — covers the PRD validation test:
  * a P2 question with strong gold support + a hand-authored reference -> decision
    `auto_resolve`, counted toward deflection, with the offline-judge faithfulness
    score recorded and exactly 1 draft + 1 judge call;
plus the failure indicators:
  * a P2 row that escalates is counted as a `false_escalate` — at the retrieval
    gate (weak, 0 draft/0 judge), on an empty draft (1 draft/0 judge), or at the
    faithfulness leg (judge below the floor, 1 draft/1 judge);
  * the faithfulness leg is the OFFLINE judge (it receives the reference the
    runtime one-call gate never sees), not the runtime gate;
  * a run with no P2 rows is NOT a pass (structurally blind deflection guard).

P3 (US-054) — the moat. Covers the PRD validation test:
  * a P3 question with strong retrieval but an unfaithful draft -> decision
    `escalate` at the FAITHFULNESS leg, `correct=True`, NOT counted as a
    false-resolve, with the offline faithfulness score recorded (1 draft/1 judge);
plus the failure indicators:
  * a P3 row that AUTO-RESOLVES (faithful draft) is a `false_resolve` — the Risk #3
    safety failure — tallied toward the false-resolve rate, never silently passed;
  * a P3 row that escalates at the RETRIEVAL gate is `mislabeled` (its retrieval
    was not actually strong, so it never exercised the faithfulness gate) — it
    escalated (safe) but is NOT a false-resolve and NOT correct;
  * the faithfulness floor is inclusive and flips the P3 verdict vs P2;
  * a run with no P3 rows is NOT a pass (structurally blind false-resolve guard).

US-055 — consolidated metrics. Covers the PRD validation test:
  * a known mix of P1a/P2/P3 producing one wrong auto-resolve (a P3 false-resolve)
    and one wrong escalate (a P2 false-escalate) -> the three rates match the
    hand-computed numerator/denominator exactly, and the false-resolve count
    includes the wrong auto-resolve;
plus the failure indicators:
  * the false-resolve number is NOT folded into a generic accuracy score — it
    carries its own numerator/denominator + per-population breakdown, and the
    ceiling-GATED rate is the P3 faithfulness-leg only (the retrieval-leg P1a/P1b
    false-resolves are surfaced monitor-only, so always-escalating true-negatives
    never dilute the safety signal);
  * a rate over an empty rate-bearing population is `None` (blind), never a false
    0.0, so an opt-out leg (P2/P3 not run) cannot masquerade as passing;
  * only the false-resolve rate is flagged as the pinned safety metric.

US-056 — knob sweep + knee. Covers the PRD validation test:
  * a labeled subset and a 2×2×2 knob grid with a KNOWN knee under a
    false-resolve ≤ 0.05 ceiling -> the curve lists every grid point's
    (deflection, false-resolve); the knee is the highest-deflection point with
    false-resolve ≤ ceiling; the knee's knob values are reported;
plus the failure indicators:
  * a knee with false-resolve ABOVE the ceiling is never chosen (a higher-deflection
    but infeasible point is rejected in favor of the feasible one);
  * when NO point satisfies the ceiling, that is reported explicitly
    (`knee_reason="no_point_under_ceiling"`), not silently downgraded to least-bad;
  * the objective is the ceiling-constrained one, not "maximize accuracy";
  * the grid memoizes per question, so an 8-point sweep drafts/judges each
    question at most once (the curve reflects knobs, not LLM re-sampling).

US-057 — P1b no-access replay. Covers the PRD validation test:
  * a P2 question replayed under a no-access viewer (gold filtered out) escalates
    at the retrieval gate — the SAME outcome as P1a, with 0 draft / 0 judge calls;
plus the failure indicators:
  * a P1b row that CLEARS the gate (the gold leaked to a no-access viewer) is
    flagged `correct=False` and fails the run (an isolation/disclosure failure);
  * NO privileged second pass: the leg is given only the no-access retrieval
    callable and retrieves exactly once per row (it receives the full question
    dict so the gold can be revoked, never a privileged/owner retrieval);
  * only P2 rows are replayed; an empty P2 population is NOT a pass;
  * a P1b leak is surfaced monitor-only in the consolidated false-resolve breakdown
    and hard-fails unconditionally, but is excluded from the ceiling-gated rate (US-055).

US-058 — P1b non-disclosure byte equality. Covers the PRD validation test:
  * a P1a row and a P1b row (a P2 question under a no-access viewer) carrying
    DIFFERENT internal gate reasons both show the customer the byte-for-byte SAME
    generic deferral — derived through the REAL `escalation._escalated` /
    `GENERIC_DEFERRAL` path — so a no-access escalation discloses no existence bit;
plus the failure indicators:
  * injecting an access-denied reason into the P1b customer output makes the
    assertion FAIL loudly (it really pins the invariant, not a trivial pass);
  * a P1b row that cleared the gate (the gold leaked → a drafted answer) is a
    non-disclosure leak too (defense in depth with the US-057 gate-clear check);
  * an empty P1b population is NOT a pass (structurally-blind guard).

US-059 — false-resolve ceiling gate. Covers the PRD core + failure indicators:
  * a measured faithfulness-leg (P3) false-resolve rate ABOVE the buyer's ceiling is
    a breach that fails the run (the pinned safety invariant the E8 gate enforces);
  * equality is feasible (rate == ceiling does NOT breach), matching the knee's
    `false_resolve <= ceiling`, and a rate strictly below passes;
  * a None rate (no P3 faithfulness-leg rows scored) is "not measured", never a
    breach — the per-leg blindness guards own structural blindness;
  * the gate is INERT on a per-PR (P1a/P1b-only, no P3) run — the gated rate is
    unmeasured (None) there, so it cannot red-bar a merge when the deterministic
    gates pass (the retrieval-leg P1a/P1b false-resolves are pinned separately);
  * the verdict to_dict + render carry ceiling/rate/n/d/breached for the weekly
    issue body.
