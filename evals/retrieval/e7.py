"""US-051 / US-108: E7 escalation golden-set schema + loader (ADR-0003 / E9).

E7 is the **support-face** layer of the one layered golden set: it scores the
deflection pipeline (the US-047 retrieval gate + the US-048 faithfulness gate)
instead of raw retrieval recall. Like E6, it is **additive** to the E4 retrieval
sweep — a separate golden set in `escalation_gold.yaml`, run by its own machinery
(US-052+), never touching the six-cell `full/partial/no_access × pre/post` sweep
in `runner.py`.

**The layered format (US-108).** The kit ships ONE layered golden-set format so a
buyer's authoring burden scales with the faces they ship:

* **Base** (every buyer) — `question → gold content-anchor labels + category`, the
  minimal primitive authored in `retrieval_gold.yaml` (US-107).
* **Derived for free** — the runner builds the three E4 viewer setups AND the E7
  P1b no-access replay from the gold labels; the buyer hand-writes neither a
  permission test nor a P1b case.
* **Support-face** (support buyers only) — one `escalation` label per question, the
  layer this module owns. It is **optional**: a knowledge-assistant-only buyer
  ships no escalation labels and runs the base + derived-for-free layers without
  error (`runner.load_questions` recognizes the layer as optional); a support
  buyer additionally runs this escalation suite.

This module owns the support-face **schema + loader + anchor resolver** (US-051 +
US-108). The P2/P3 gold labels are authored on the SAME US-107 content-anchor
primitive as the base layer — an answer-bearing `gold_anchors` span resolved to
the current chunk stable_id(s) at eval time (`content_anchors.py`), replacing the
legacy directly-authored `gold_stable_ids` chunk-index list. So a
`chunk_size`/overlap re-seed needs ZERO re-labeling here too, and an anchor that
matches no chunk is a HARD ERROR (never a silent miss). The populations are still
*derived from the existing gold anchor*, not authored as a parallel set: each
question carries exactly one `escalation` label.

The three hand-authored populations (E9 support-face layer) and their P-codes:

* ``no_context``          → **P1a** — genuinely-no-context: the answer is absent
  from the corpus, so the row has **no** gold chunks. Expected to escalate at
  the *retrieval* gate (weak cosine), with no draft/judge call (US-052).
* ``answerable_faithful`` → **P2**  — strong retrieval **and** a faithful
  grounded answer exists from the gold chunks. Expected to auto-resolve; the
  deflection rate is measured on this population (US-053).
* ``should_escalate``     → **P3**  — strong retrieval **but no** faithful
  grounded answer (the topic is on-corpus, the specific fact is not, or the doc
  defers to a human). Expected to clear retrieval yet fail the faithfulness gate
  and escalate (US-054). This is the moat case: a P3 that auto-resolves is a
  *false-resolve* (Risk #3), the safety metric the ceiling governs (US-055/059).

P2-vs-P3 is the *only* human judgment in authoring ("does a faithful answer
exist from these chunks?"); P1a-vs-the-rest follows mechanically from "are there
gold chunks?".

**P1b is deliberately NOT a label here.** P1b — a question that *is* answerable
in general but for which *this viewer* can see no gold chunk — is the derived,
viewer-parameterized case (US-057): the runner reconstructs it at run time from a
P2/P3 row via `runner.compute_visible_stable_ids`'s ``no_access`` construction.
It is never hand-authored, so the schema has no `p1b` value and the loader
rejects one as out-of-enum.

    """Load + validate the E7 escalation golden set (US-051).

    Mirrors the enum/dedup discipline of `runner.load_questions`: a top-level
    `questions` non-empty list, each row with a unique string `id`, a non-empty
    `question`, and exactly one `escalation` label in `ESCALATION_LABELS`. The
    gold anchor is **required and non-empty** for the gold-chunk labels
    (`answerable_faithful` / `should_escalate`) — a US-107 `gold_anchors` list of
    content anchors, structurally validated by `content_anchors.parse_gold_anchors`
    (bare string or `{text, doc}` mapping) — and **forbidden** for `no_context`

    (`answerable_faithful` P2, US-053; `should_escalate` P3, US-054) each

    Claude judge scores the drafted answer against (for P3 the gold encodes the

    out-of-enum label (including a hand-authored `p1b`) names the allowed set, so
    a typo or a stray P1b row fails loudly instead of being silently scored.
    Returns the raw question dicts unchanged (the scoring runner — US-052+ —
    consumes them), so this loader stays pure: no DB, no network, no backend
    import. This validates only the anchor *structure*; RESOLVING each anchor to a
    current chunk stable_id (and the fail-loud zero-resolve check) is a
    scoring-time concern handled by `resolve_escalation_gold`, not here.
