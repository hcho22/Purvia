"""US-052/053/054: E7 runner — P1a + P2 + P3 deflection-pipeline scoring.

E7 scores the **deflection pipeline** (ADR-0003), not raw retrieval recall, over
the escalation golden set loaded by `e7.load_escalation_questions` (US-051). This
module owns the runner's three hand-authored legs:

* the **P1a population** (US-052) — questions whose answer is genuinely absent
  from the corpus, which must escalate at the cheap, deterministic *retrieval
  gate* before any draft or judge call is made;
* the **P2 population** (US-053) — questions a faithful grounded answer exists
  for, which must clear the retrieval gate *and* produce a faithful draft, so the
  pipeline should **auto-resolve** them. A P2 that escalates is a
  **false-escalate** (an annoyance cost, not a safety failure); and
* the **P3 population** (US-054) — the moat case: questions with *strong*
  retrieval but **no faithful grounded answer** (the topic is on-corpus, the
  specific fact is not, or the doc defers to a human). A P3 must clear the
  retrieval gate, draft, and then be caught by the *faithfulness* leg → escalate.
  A P3 that **auto-resolves is a false-resolve** — the Risk #3 safety failure the
  false-resolve ceiling governs (US-055/059). A P3 that escalates at the
  *retrieval* gate is **mislabeled** (its retrieval was not actually strong, so it
  never exercised the faithfulness gate the row exists to prove).

The legs differ sharply on determinism and CI placement (US-059):

* **P1a is deterministic** — pure arithmetic on cosine scores, no LLM — so it is
  the per-PR tripwire and may hard-block a merge.
* **P2 and P3 are LLM-judged** — they draft an answer and score that draft's
  faithfulness with the **OFFLINE cross-family Claude judge** (`runner.judge_answer`,
  the same judge the E4 generation table uses), NOT the runtime one-call
  faithfulness gate (`escalation.faithfulness_gate`). The offline judge is a
  cross-family observation (Claude grading gpt-4o-mini drafts), so it does not
  share the same-model bias the runtime gate would, and it is free to be
  slower/multi-pass off the latency path. Because they are LLM-judged, the P2/P3
  legs are **scheduled (weekly)** artifacts; their deflection / false-escalate /
  false-resolve numbers feed the US-055 consolidated rates and the E8 gate
  (US-059). No P2/P3 leg *individually* hard-blocks a merge — the per-PR exit
  code is decided by the deterministic gate invariants (P1a/P1b retrieval-gate +
  the US-058 non-disclosure assertion). The one number the weekly legs can fail
  on is the **consolidated false-resolve rate vs the buyer's ceiling**
  (`assert_false_resolve_ceiling`, US-059) — a pinned safety invariant, never a
  per-PR block (the per-PR run never scores the P3 faithfulness leg, so it carries
  an accepted up-to-a-week detection latency).

P2 and P3 run the **identical** pipeline traversal — `retrieve → retrieval_gate →
[if strong] draft → offline faithfulness judge → auto-resolve-or-escalate`
(`_run_judged_leg`) — and differ ONLY in how they *label* the outcome: a P2
auto-resolve is correct (deflection) while a P3 auto-resolve is a false-resolve;
a P2 escalation is a false-escalate while a P3 faithfulness-leg escalation is the
correct, moat-proving outcome.

Why P1a is special
------------------
The P1a outcome is decided by **pure arithmetic on cosine scores** — there is no
LLM in the loop — so it is deterministic and can hard-block per-PR (US-059's
per-PR tripwire), unlike the P2/P3 faithfulness legs (US-053/054) which are
LLM-judged and therefore weekly. Accordingly this module:

* reuses the **real backend gate** `escalation.retrieval_gate` (US-047) — a future
  PR that breaks the gate breaks E7, exactly as `runner.py` reuses the real
  `search_documents` / `hybrid_search`; and
* makes **zero** draft and **zero** judge calls on the P1a path — this leg has no
  answerer or judge client at all, so "0 draft / 0 judge" is structural, not a
  policy that could regress. The orchestrator records `draft_calls=0` /
  `judge_calls=0` on every decision so the invariant is explicit and auditable in
  the JSON.

A P1a row that *clears* the retrieval gate would proceed to a draft — for a
genuinely-no-context question that is a **false-resolve risk** (Risk #3), the
safety failure the false-resolve ceiling governs (US-055/059). Such a row is
flagged `correct=False` and fails the run.

Scope so far (US-052/053/054/055/056/057): the P1a retrieval-gate leg, the P2
auto-resolve leg, the P3 should-escalate leg, the **consolidated** deflection /
false-resolve / false-escalate metrics (US-055, `compute_e7_metrics`) that roll
the per-leg outcomes into the operating-objective numbers — each carrying its
numerator/denominator + per-population breakdown so the false-resolve number is
verifiable against the buyer's ceiling (US-059) and never folded into an opaque
accuracy score — the **knob sweep** (US-056, `run_e7_sweep`) that grids over
τ_sim / N_min / the offline faithfulness floor, emits the
deflection-vs-false-resolve curve, and selects the deflection-maximizing **knee**
subject to the false-resolve ceiling, and the **P1b** no-access replay (US-057,
`run_e7_p1b`) that re-runs the P2 questions under a no-access viewer (gold
ACL-revoked via the E4 machinery) and asserts they escalate at the retrieval gate
exactly as P1a does — with no privileged second pass — and the **P1b
non-disclosure byte-equality assertion** (US-058, `assert_p1b_non_disclosure`)
that pins the customer-facing escalation bytes byte-for-byte identical to the P1a
generic deferral, so a no-access escalation never discloses that restricted
content exists. Still to land: the CI placement (US-059).
This is kept a **standalone** runner (its own `python -m evals.retrieval.e7_runner`
entry, distinct from the E4 `runner.py`) because the deterministic P1a gate leg is
the per-PR tripwire (US-059) and must not pay for the full E4 sweep + RAGAS
machinery to run; the LLM-judged P2/P3 legs are opt-in via `--include-p2` /
`--include-p3`.

# US-054: P3 (should-escalate) — the moat case.
#
# A P3 row has STRONG retrieval but NO faithful grounded answer (the topic is
# on-corpus, the specific fact is not, or the doc defers to a human). It runs the
# SAME shared pipeline traversal as P2 (`_run_judged_leg`) but with the OPPOSITE
# expectation: the only correct P3 outcome is to clear the retrieval gate, draft,
# and then be caught by the FAITHFULNESS leg → escalate. The labeling therefore
# flips relative to P2:
#
#   * escalate at the faithfulness leg ⇒ CORRECT (the moat working);
#   * auto-resolve                     ⇒ FALSE-RESOLVE — the Risk #3 safety
#     failure the false-resolve ceiling governs (US-055/059), NOT a false-escalate;
#   * escalate at the retrieval/draft leg ⇒ MISLABELED — the row escalated (the
#     safe direction) but never exercised the faithfulness gate it exists to
#     prove, so its retrieval was not actually strong (a gold-authoring defect),
#     not a pipeline result.
#
# Like P2 this leg is LLM-judged (offline cross-family Claude judge), so it is a
# scheduled/weekly artifact and only REPORTS here — the false-resolve RATE vs the
# buyer's ceiling is consolidated in US-055 and enforced in CI by US-059. This
# runner's exit code stays decided by the deterministic P1a invariant alone.

# US-057: P1b — viewer-parameterized no-access population (reuse E4).
#
# P1b is NOT a hand-authored gold population — US-051 adds no `p1b` label. It is
# the SAME P2 (`answerable_faithful`) questions REPLAYED under a NO-ACCESS viewer:
# the E4 `reset_viewer_acls` / `compute_visible_stable_ids(... "no_access" ...)`
# machinery revokes each question's gold from the viewer, so from the viewer's own
# retrieval the gold is invisible and retrieval is weak. The only correct P1b
# outcome is therefore IDENTICAL to P1a — escalate at the deterministic retrieval
# gate — and, like P1a, the leg makes ZERO draft and ZERO judge calls.
#
# The point of P1b is the access-filtered case: the same question a full-access
# viewer can answer (P2) must escalate for a no-access viewer, and must do so
# WITHOUT the customer learning that restricted content exists. That
# non-disclosure is structurally guaranteed here by what is ABSENT: there is NO
# privileged second pass. The leg is given exactly one retrieval callable — the
# no-access viewer's own (gold-filtered) retrieval — and never an unfiltered /
# owner retrieval, so a "this question is actually answerable for someone" signal
# can never reach the decision. P1b is decided ONLY from the no-access viewer's
# filtered retrieval, exactly as P1a is, so its customer-facing output is
# byte-identical to P1a's generic deferral (the invariant US-058 pins).
#
# A P1b row that CLEARS the gate is a defect (`correct=False`) — worse than a P1a
# near-miss: it means the access filter LEAKED the gold to a no-access viewer (a
# real isolation failure, E6/AU4 territory) or the question is answerable from
# non-gold chunks (a gold-authoring defect). Either way it would draft for a
# no-access viewer — a false-resolve AND a disclosure risk — so it fails the run,
# the same pinned shape as a P1a cleared gate. Deterministic (gate-only, no LLM),
# so P1b is part of the per-PR tripwire (US-059), not the weekly LLM-judged sweep.

# US-055: consolidated operating-objective metrics.
#
# The per-leg results above each compute a population-LOCAL rate (P2's
# deflection, P3's false-resolve). US-055 consolidates them into the three
# canonical rates the operating objective is stated in — "maximize deflection
# subject to false-resolve ≤ ceiling":
#
#   * deflection     = correctly auto-resolved / ANSWERABLE      (maximize)
#   * false-resolve  = wrongly auto-resolved   / UNANSWERABLE    (the SAFETY number)
#   * false-escalate = wrongly escalated       / ANSWERABLE      (annoyance)
#
# Populations (from the E7 labels, US-051):
#   * answerable   = P2 (a faithful grounded answer exists).
#   * unanswerable = P1a (no context) + P3 (strong retrieval, no faithful answer)
#     + P1b (US-057 — P2 questions under a no-access viewer, the gold filtered
#     out). P1b is OPTIONAL: it is folded into the false-resolve number only when
#     its (DB-backed) leg ran, so the safety number stays complete once P1b exists
#     without forcing every caller to run the no-access replay.
#
# Each rate is emitted with its explicit numerator/denominator AND a
# per-population breakdown so a regression is attributable to a single leg and the
# false-resolve number is verifiable against the buyer's ceiling (US-059) — never
# collapsed into an opaque "accuracy" score. `compute_e7_metrics` only REPORTS the
# rates; `assert_false_resolve_ceiling` (below, US-059) is where the false-resolve
# ≤ ceiling check is ENFORCED as a pinned safety invariant in the runner's exit
# code, alongside the deterministic P1a/P1b gate + non-disclosure invariants.

# unlike the tunable deflection / false-escalate quality metrics the E8 gate
# governs (US-059 AC3).

# runs only the deterministic P1a/P1b legs, so per-PR the rate carries only the
# retrieval-leg contribution — already independently pinned by the P1a/P1b gate

# LLM-judged P3 faithfulness leg, so the faithfulness-leg false-resolve is what
# this ceiling actually catches — at an accepted up-to-a-week detection latency
# (docs/evals.md "E7 CI placement"; F3/P5).
#
# A `None` rate (no unanswerable rows scored) is "not measured", NOT a breach:
