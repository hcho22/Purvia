"""US-052/053/054: E7 runner — P1a + P2 + P3 deflection-pipeline scoring.

E7 scores the **deflection pipeline** (ADR-0003), not raw retrieval recall, over
the escalation golden set loaded by `e7.load_escalation_questions` (US-051). This
module owns the runner's three hand-authored legs:

* the **P1a population** (US-052) — questions whose answer is genuinely absent
  from the corpus, which must escalate at the cheap, deterministic *retrieval
  gate* before any draft or judge call is made;
* the **P2 population** (US-053) — questions a faithful grounded answer exists
  for, which must clear the retrieval gate *and* produce a faithful draft, so the
  pipeline should **auto-resolve** them. A P2 that escalates is a
  **false-escalate** (an annoyance cost, not a safety failure); and
* the **P3 population** (US-054) — the moat case: questions with *strong*
  retrieval but **no grounded answer that actually answers them** (the topic is
  on-corpus, the specific fact is not, or the doc defers to a human). A P3 must
  clear the retrieval gate, draft, and then be caught by a *content* gate →
  escalate: the *faithfulness* leg (an ungrounded draft) or the issue-#97 *answer*
  leg (a grounded draft that does not answer — a faithful "the corpus doesn't
  cover this" deferral). Both are correct. A P3 that **auto-resolves is a
  false-resolve** — the Risk #3 safety failure the false-resolve ceiling governs
  (US-055/059). A P3 that escalates at the *retrieval* gate is **mislabeled** (its
  retrieval was not actually strong, so it never exercised the content gates the
  row exists to prove).

The legs differ sharply on determinism and CI placement (US-059):

* **P1a is deterministic** — pure arithmetic on cosine scores, no LLM — so it is
  the per-PR tripwire and may hard-block a merge.
* **P2 and P3 are LLM-judged** — they draft an answer and score that draft with
  TWO **OFFLINE cross-family Claude judges**: faithfulness (`runner.judge_answer`,
  the same judge the E4 generation table uses) and, on the would-be-answered path,
  answer-completeness (`runner.judge_answering`, the issue-#97 gate) — NOT the
  runtime one-call gates (`escalation.faithfulness_gate` / `escalation.answer_gate`).
  The offline judges are a cross-family observation (Claude grading gpt-4o-mini
  drafts), so they do not share the same-model bias the runtime gates would, and
  are free to be slower/multi-pass off the latency path. Because they are
  LLM-judged, the P2/P3
  legs are **scheduled (weekly)** artifacts; their deflection / false-escalate /
  false-resolve numbers feed the US-055 consolidated rates and the E8 gate
  (US-059). No P2/P3 leg *individually* hard-blocks a merge — the per-PR exit
  code is decided by the deterministic gate invariants (P1a/P1b retrieval-gate +
  the US-058 non-disclosure assertion). The one number the weekly legs can fail
  on is the **consolidated false-resolve rate vs the buyer's ceiling**
  (`assert_false_resolve_ceiling`, US-059) — a pinned safety invariant, never a
  per-PR block (the per-PR run never scores the P3 faithfulness leg, so it carries
  an accepted up-to-a-week detection latency).

P2 and P3 run the **identical** pipeline traversal — `retrieve → retrieval_gate →
[if strong] draft → offline faithfulness judge → [if faithful] offline
answer-completeness judge → auto-resolve-or-escalate` (`_run_judged_leg`, mirroring
the runtime `run_deflection_pipeline` including the issue-#97 answer gate) — and
differ ONLY in how they *label* the outcome: a P2 auto-resolve is correct
(deflection) while a P3 auto-resolve is a false-resolve; a P2 escalation is a
false-escalate while a P3 content-gate escalation (faithfulness OR answer) is the
correct, moat-proving outcome.

Why P1a is special
------------------
The P1a outcome is decided by **pure arithmetic on cosine scores** — there is no
LLM in the loop — so it is deterministic and can hard-block per-PR (US-059's
per-PR tripwire), unlike the P2/P3 faithfulness legs (US-053/054) which are
LLM-judged and therefore weekly. Accordingly this module:

* reuses the **real backend gate** `escalation.retrieval_gate` (US-047) — a future
  PR that breaks the gate breaks E7, exactly as `runner.py` reuses the real
  `search_documents` / `hybrid_search`; and
* makes **zero** draft and **zero** judge calls on the P1a path — this leg has no
  answerer or judge client at all, so "0 draft / 0 judge" is structural, not a
  policy that could regress. The orchestrator records `draft_calls=0` /
  `judge_calls=0` on every decision so the invariant is explicit and auditable in
  the JSON.

A P1a row that *clears* the retrieval gate would proceed to a draft — for a
genuinely-no-context question that is a **false-resolve risk** (Risk #3), the
safety failure the false-resolve ceiling governs (US-055/059). Such a row is
flagged `correct=False` and fails the run.

Scope so far (US-052/053/054/055/056/057): the P1a retrieval-gate leg, the P2
auto-resolve leg, the P3 should-escalate leg, the **consolidated** deflection /
false-resolve / false-escalate metrics (US-055, `compute_e7_metrics`) that roll
the per-leg outcomes into the operating-objective numbers — each carrying its
numerator/denominator + per-population breakdown so the false-resolve number is
verifiable against the buyer's ceiling (US-059) and never folded into an opaque
accuracy score — the **knob sweep** (US-056, `run_e7_sweep`) that grids over
τ_sim / N_min / the offline faithfulness floor, emits the
deflection-vs-false-resolve curve, and selects the deflection-maximizing **knee**
subject to the false-resolve ceiling, and the **P1b** no-access replay (US-057,
`run_e7_p1b`) that re-runs the P2 questions under a no-access viewer (gold
ACL-revoked via the E4 machinery) and asserts they escalate at the retrieval gate
exactly as P1a does — with no privileged second pass — and the **P1b
non-disclosure byte-equality assertion** (US-058, `assert_p1b_non_disclosure`)
that pins the customer-facing escalation bytes byte-for-byte identical to the P1a
generic deferral, so a no-access escalation never discloses that restricted
content exists. Still to land: the CI placement (US-059).
This is kept a **standalone** runner (its own `python -m evals.retrieval.e7_runner`
entry, distinct from the E4 `runner.py`) because the deterministic P1a gate leg is
the per-PR tripwire (US-059) and must not pay for the full E4 sweep + RAGAS
machinery to run; the LLM-judged P2/P3 legs are opt-in via `--include-p2` /
`--include-p3`.

    grounded P3 deferral scores 5/5 faithful and auto-resolves as a false-resolve

    judge receives the row's `reference` gold answer (validated by

# US-054: P3 (should-escalate) — the moat case.
#
# A P3 row has STRONG retrieval but NO grounded answer that actually answers it
# (the topic is on-corpus, the specific fact is not, or the doc defers to a
# human). It runs the SAME shared pipeline traversal as P2 (`_run_judged_leg`) but
# with the OPPOSITE expectation: the only correct P3 outcome is to clear the
# retrieval gate, draft, and then be caught by a CONTENT gate → escalate. A P3
# draft can fail either content gate: an ungrounded draft trips the FAITHFULNESS
# leg, and a grounded-but-non-answering draft (a "the corpus doesn't cover
# jewelry" deferral, faithful 5/5 yet answering nothing) trips the issue-#97
# ANSWER leg. Both are the moat working. The labeling therefore flips relative
# to P2:
#
#   * escalate at the faithfulness OR answer leg ⇒ CORRECT (the moat working —
#     the draft was caught by a content gate after clearing retrieval);
#   * auto-resolve                     ⇒ FALSE-RESOLVE — the Risk #3 safety
#     failure the false-resolve ceiling governs (US-055/059), NOT a false-escalate;
#   * escalate at the retrieval/draft leg ⇒ MISLABELED — the row escalated (the
#     safe direction) but never exercised the content gates it exists to
#     prove, so its retrieval was not actually strong (a gold-authoring defect),
#     not a pipeline result.
#
# Modeling the answer leg is the issue-#96 fix: before it, a grounded P3 deferral
# scored 5/5 faithful and AUTO-RESOLVED as a false-resolve, so the whole P3 leg
# read 100% false-resolve and breached the ceiling even though the runtime
# pipeline (post issue #97) correctly escalates every one of those drafts.
#
# Like P2 this leg is LLM-judged (offline cross-family Claude judge), so it is a
# scheduled/weekly artifact and only REPORTS here — the false-resolve RATE vs the
# buyer's ceiling is consolidated in US-055 and enforced in CI by US-059. This

      judge scored it below the floor) OR the issue-#97 answer leg (faithful but
      the answer judge said the grounded draft does not answer the question).
    * `false_resolve` — auto-resolved: the draft scored faithful AND answered, so
      the pipeline WOULD have auto-sent an answer to an unanswerable question.
      This is the Risk #3 safety failure (US-055/059), tallied toward the rate.
    * `mislabeled` — escalated at the retrieval or draft leg, so it never reached
      the content judges. It escalated (the safe direction, so NOT a
      false-resolve) but did not exercise the gates the row exists to prove —
      surfaced so the gold row can be re-authored.

    `escalate_leg` records where an escalation happened (``None`` on an
    auto-resolve); `faithfulness_score` / `helpfulness_score` are the OFFLINE
    judge's 1-5 integers (``None`` when the row escalated before a faithfulness-judge
    call); `answered` is the OFFLINE answer-completeness verdict (``None`` when the
    row escalated before that gate); `draft_calls` / `judge_calls` /
    `answer_judge_calls` are the actual calls made so the LLM cost is auditable.

# US-057: P1b — viewer-parameterized no-access population (reuse E4).
#
# P1b is NOT a hand-authored gold population — US-051 adds no `p1b` label. It is
# the SAME P2 (`answerable_faithful`) questions REPLAYED under a NO-ACCESS viewer:
# the E4 `reset_viewer_acls` / `compute_visible_stable_ids(... "no_access" ...)`
# machinery revokes each question's gold from the viewer, so from the viewer's own
# retrieval the gold is invisible and retrieval is weak. The only correct P1b
# outcome is therefore IDENTICAL to P1a — escalate at the deterministic retrieval
# gate — and, like P1a, the leg makes ZERO draft and ZERO judge calls.
#
# The point of P1b is the access-filtered case: the same question a full-access
# viewer can answer (P2) must escalate for a no-access viewer, and must do so
# WITHOUT the customer learning that restricted content exists. That
# non-disclosure is structurally guaranteed here by what is ABSENT: there is NO
# privileged second pass. The leg is given exactly one retrieval callable — the
# no-access viewer's own (gold-filtered) retrieval — and never an unfiltered /
# owner retrieval, so a "this question is actually answerable for someone" signal
# can never reach the decision. P1b is decided ONLY from the no-access viewer's
# filtered retrieval, exactly as P1a is, so its customer-facing output is
# byte-identical to P1a's generic deferral (the invariant US-058 pins).
#
# A P1b row that CLEARS the gate is a defect (`correct=False`) — worse than a P1a
# near-miss: it means the access filter LEAKED the gold to a no-access viewer (a
# real isolation failure, E6/AU4 territory) or the question is answerable from
# non-gold chunks (a gold-authoring defect). Either way it would draft for a
# no-access viewer — a false-resolve AND a disclosure risk — so it fails the run,
# the same pinned shape as a P1a cleared gate. Deterministic (gate-only, no LLM),
# so P1b is part of the per-PR tripwire (US-059), not the weekly LLM-judged sweep.

    the production path revokes that question's gold from the no-access viewer
    (the E4 `reset_viewer_acls` machinery) and then retrieves under the viewer's
    own JWT, so the gold is filtered out by RLS + the membership clause.

    The leak verdict is **identity-based**: each returned chunk id is mapped to its
    corpus `stable_id` (via `stable_id_by_chunk_id`) and a row LEAKS iff a gold
    stable id actually appears in the no-access viewer's retrieved set

    the real isolation invariant: a no-access viewer legitimately holds every
    non-gold corpus chunk (the E4 no-access construction grants all-but-the-gold),
    so its retrieval can read STRONG off topic-adjacent non-gold chunks (e.g. the
    gold document's sibling chunk) with no gold leaked — that is correct, not a
    leak. Conversely a gold chunk returned below `tau_sim` (gate weak) is STILL a

    the run. The gate decision is still recorded (for reporting + the US-058

# US-058: P1b non-disclosure assertion (pinned security invariant).
#
# US-057 proves the ISOLATION invariant — no gold chunk reaches the no-access
# viewer (`E7P1bResult.cleared_gate`, identity-based). US-058 pins the orthogonal,
# customer-visible invariant on the ESCALATION PATH: when a no-access row DOES
# escalate (its retrieval is weak), the BYTES the customer sees are byte-for-byte
# identical to the P1a generic-deferral bytes, so escalating never discloses that
# restricted content exists — no `reason`, no `restricted-to`, no existence bit
# echoed to the customer. US-058 is DECOUPLED from the US-057 leak check: it scores
# only escalating rows, not draft rows (a no-access viewer drafting from
# legitimately-granted NON-gold chunks is not a restricted-content disclosure — the
# gold-leak case is owned entirely by US-057's identity check).
#
# It is a binary leak invariant (`assert leak == 0`) in the E8 pinned-`fail`
# security/correctness class (US-059) — NOT buyer-downgradable to comment/off;
# silencing it requires deleting the eval, not configuring it down — and is
# DETERMINISTIC (string/byte equality, no LLM judge), so it joins the per-PR
# tripwire and may hard-block a merge. Access-aware reason/routing surfacing is
# explicitly out of scope (a future S4 authorized-agent surface, gated on its own
# existence-non-disclosure eval).
#
# The customer output is derived through the REAL production escalate constructor
# (`escalation._escalated` → `escalation.GENERIC_DEFERRAL`), fed each row's OWN
# (per-row-DIFFERENT) gate decision + internal reason. So the assertion proves the
# customer bytes are invariant to the differing internal reason / cosine / access
# state — it would catch a future change that let the customer message reflect
# them — rather than comparing two hardcoded copies of the deferral string.

#     population — the cases where a false-resolve can actually occur once a draft
#     clears the retrieval gate. The RETRIEVAL-leg false-resolves (P1a no-context /

        rate: P3 rows (should-escalate, strong retrieval) that *auto-resolved*, over
        the P3 population — the cases where a false-resolve can actually occur once a
        draft clears the retrieval gate. This is the rate US-059 gates against the

        (no-access replay of P2, US-057) rows that *cleared the gate* — are carried
        in the breakdown for monitoring (`counts_toward_rate=False`) but EXCLUDED
        from this rate: each is a zero-tolerance invariant the P1a/P1b gate checks
        hard-fail unconditionally (any nonzero count is a no-context draft / a gold
        leak, critical regardless of rate), so folding always-escalating
        true-negatives into the denominator would only dilute the ceiling-gated
        number — worse as the gold set grows (each P2 adds a P1b row).
      * **false-escalate** = wrongly escalated P2 / answerable — the annoyance
        number (the complement of deflection over the P2 population).

    P2 / P3 / P1b are opt-in legs (`--include-p2` / `--include-p3` /
    `--include-p1b`); when a leg was not run its population contributes nothing (and
    a rate over an all-empty rate-bearing set is `None` — surfaced as blind rather
    than a false 0.0). Because the gated false-resolve rate is the P3 leg, a per-PR
    run (P1a/P1b only, no P3) reports it as `None`/not-measured — the ceiling gate
    is inert there and the retrieval-leg invariants own per-PR safety. A P3 row that
    escalated before the faithfulness gate (`mislabeled`) is a *safe* outcome — it
    stays in the P3 (faithfulness-leg) denominator but is NOT counted toward the
    false-resolve numerator. The P3 false-resolve denominator is therefore the FULL
    presented P3 population (`p3.n_questions`, mislabeled rows included), NOT the
    exercised-only subset: that full-population denominator is the operating-metric
    meaning and keeps this sum-based consolidated rate from mixing per-population
    denominators (the rejected "exercised-only" misread, issue #26). The dilution a
    heavily-mislabeled P3 leg would cause is caught by the separate mislabel-ratio
    guard (issue #26), never by shrinking this denominator. This function only
    computes the rates; US-059 enforces the ceiling.

#
# `compute_e7_metrics` (US-055) REPORTS the consolidated false-resolve rate with
# its explicit numerator/denominator; this is where US-059 ENFORCES it. The
# buyer's `get_false_resolve_ceiling()` (US-050) is the one risk number; a
# measured false-resolve rate above it is a safety breach that fails the run —
# the same pinned-`fail`, non-downgradable shape as the P1a/P1b gate invariants
# and the US-058 non-disclosure assertion. It is never softened to a comment,
# unlike the tunable deflection / false-escalate quality metrics the E8 gate
# governs (US-059 AC3).
#
# The gated rate is the faithfulness leg (P3), so the per-PR tripwire (the
# deterministic P1a/P1b legs only, no P3) reports it as `None`/not-measured — this
# ceiling gate is INERT there, and the retrieval-leg P1a/P1b false-resolves are
# independently pinned by the P1a/P1b gate checks (a zero-tolerance invariant). The
# weekly sweep adds the LLM-judged P3 faithfulness leg, so the faithfulness-leg
# false-resolve is what this ceiling actually catches — at an accepted up-to-a-week
# detection latency (docs/evals.md "E7 CI placement"; F3/P5).
#
# A `None` rate (no unanswerable rows scored) is "not measured", NOT a breach, so
# this gate fires only on a MEASURED rate that exceeds the ceiling. The
# structurally-blind failure is owned elsewhere: a per-PR run legitimately has no P3
# leg, while a requested P3 leg that never EXERCISES the faithfulness gate is
# hard-failed by the P3 positive-control guard in `e7_pinned_invariants_failed`
# (mirroring the P1a/P1b blindness guards). That guard covers both disarm paths — an
# empty P3 leg (rate `None`) AND an entirely-mislabeled one (every row escalates
# before the gate, so the rate reads a vacuous measured 0%) — so neither can
# silently disarm the ceiling.

    wires the live legs into it). Returns True iff a pinned safety invariant fired;
    each fired invariant logs at ERROR first, so the caller can write the JSON
    snapshot before exiting and the cause is preserved.

    The pinned invariants (none ever softened to a comment, unlike the tunable
    deflection/false-escalate metrics the E8 gate governs):

      * a P1a no-context row that CLEARS the retrieval gate (a retrieval-leg
        false-resolve), or a P1b no-access-replay row that RETURNED a gold chunk to
        the no-access viewer (an isolation/disclosure failure, identity-measured —
        independent of the answerability gate); zero-tolerance, hard-fails
        unconditionally regardless of rate;
      * a P1b non-disclosure byte mismatch (a customer output that differs from the
        P1a generic deferral, disclosing restricted content exists);
      * a structurally-blind positive control on ANY requested leg — fail closed,
        because a blind eval cannot prove the invariant. For P1a/P1b/non-disclosure
        this means 0 rows scored. For the P3 faithfulness leg the bar is stricter:
        the false-resolve ceiling is fed SOLELY by P3, so it must verify the gate was
        actually EXERCISED, not merely that rows exist. `E7P3Result.passed` requires
        ≥1 row to clear retrieval, draft, and reach a faithfulness verdict, closing
        BOTH disarm paths — an empty P3 leg (rate `None`, "not measured") AND a
        non-empty but entirely-mislabeled P3 leg (every row escalates at the
        retrieval/draft leg, so the rate reads a vacuous measured 0% that never
        breaches). Either way the gold drifted out from under the ceiling;
      * a P3 mislabel-RATIO breach (issue #26): the positive control above closes
        only the TOTAL-dilution case (zero exercised); a leg that is HEAVILY but not
        entirely mislabeled still exercises ≥1 row, passes the positive control, yet
        measures the false-resolve ceiling over a shrunken sample that can mask a bad
        faithfulness gate as the P3 gold grows. This guard fails the run when the
        mislabeled fraction over the full presented population exceeds
        `p3_mislabel_ratio_max`, catching that partial dilution;
      * a MEASURED faithfulness-leg (P3) false-resolve rate above the buyer's ceiling;
      * the offline-vs-runtime answer-gate PARITY leg (decision-gate-parity): the
        weekly rate is scored by the OFFLINE judge, so an agreement between that
        judge and the RUNTIME gate `escalation.answer_gate` (what actually ships
        the send/escalate verdict) is a pinned invariant, asserted independently
        and NEVER scored into the rate. Refuses to certify on zero eligible rows,
        judge failure, or missing context (each UNMEASURED, invariant 12), and
        fails hard on any mismatch (offline judge = shipped gate disagreement).

    A per-PR run carries no P3 leg (p3_result is None), so the P3 guards never trip
    it there — only the deterministic P1a/P1b gate + non-disclosure invariants gate a
    merge. The ceiling gate is likewise inert per-PR (an unmeasured rate is not a
    breach); it has teeth once the weekly P3 leg feeds the rate.
